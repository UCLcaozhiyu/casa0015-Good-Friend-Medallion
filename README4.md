- Automatic position updates
- High-accuracy location services
- Location permission handling
- Location service status checking

### 3. User Interface
- Clean and intuitive design
- Real-time updates of position and direction
- Error handling and user notifications
- Permission request dialogs
- Location service status indicators

## Technical Implementation

### Location Services
- Uses `geolocator` package for location services

- Handles location permissions and service status
- Updates position every 10 meters of movement
- Provides fallback handling for location service issues

### Compass Functionality
- Uses device sensors for compass readings
- Calculates bearing to target location
- Updates compass direction in real-time
- Handles device orientation changes

### Error Handling
- Location service disabled notifications
