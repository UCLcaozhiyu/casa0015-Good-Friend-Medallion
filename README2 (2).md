# **üîµ P2P Direction Finder**
**"Find your target, no server required."**

> üìå **A Bluetooth & WiFi Direct-based peer-to-peer location and direction finder.**  
> Inspired by the **Witcher's medallion**, this app vibrates when you are close to another user running the app. The closer you get, the stronger the vibration.

## **üöÄ Features**
‚úÖ **P2P Communication** ‚Äì No cloud, no server, full privacy.  
‚úÖ **Hybrid Bluetooth & WiFi Direct** ‚Äì BLE for discovery, WiFi Direct for fast data exchange.  
‚úÖ **Real-time Distance & Direction** ‚Äì Uses GPS & device sensors to calculate target location.  
‚úÖ **Vibration Feedback** ‚Äì The closer you get, the stronger the vibration.  
‚úÖ **Works Offline** ‚Äì Ideal for rescue, social encounters, or real-world games.

## **üõ†Ô∏è How It Works**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Discovery via Bluetooth (BLE)**
- The mobile phone positioning system provides coordinates.
- One device **advertises** itself via BLE.
- Another device **scans** and finds the target.
- BLE only sends **basic info** (WiFi SSID, unique ID).

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ High-Speed Data Exchange via WiFi Direct**
- Once discovered, devices switch to **WiFi Direct**.
- **GPS and compass data** are exchanged in real-time.
- **Distance & direction** are computed **locally**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Real-time Feedback**
- The app calculates **bearing & distance**.
- **Vibration intensity increases** as you get closer.
- No internet required! **Fully offline, private, secure.**

## **üì¶ Installation**
### **üîπ Prerequisites**
- **Flutter 3.0+**
- **Android 10+ (for WiFi Direct)**
- **Bluetooth & Location Permissions Enabled**

### **üîπ Clone & Run**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/UCLcaozhiyu/CASA0015-Mobile-Systems-Interactions.git
cd P2P-Direction-Finder
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
