# Application Update Log

## April 28, 2024 - Bluetooth Functionality Optimization

### 1. Device List Display Enhancement
- Restored and improved RSSI signal strength display
- Added distance category indicators (Very Close/Near/Moderate/Far)
- Implemented color-coded signal strength:
  - Green: Strong signal (> -70 dBm)
  - Orange: Medium signal (-90 to -70 dBm)
  - Red: Weak signal (< -90 dBm)
