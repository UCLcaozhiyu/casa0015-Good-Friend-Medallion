# Good Friend Medallion 🧙‍♂️

> "When danger is near, it trembles..." - Inspired by the Witcher's medallion, this app helps you sense your friends in the real world.

## 🌟 Overview

Good Friend Medallion is an innovative P2P direction finder that combines Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi Direct technology to help you find your friends in the real world. Just like the Witcher's medallion vibrates when magic is near, this app provides haptic feedback as you get closer to your friends.

**"Find your target, no server required."**

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 Core Functionality
- **P2P Communication** – No cloud, no server, full privacy
- **Hybrid Technology** – BLE for discovery, WiFi Direct for fast data exchange
- **Real-time Updates** – Instant distance and direction information
- **Works Offline** – Ideal for rescue, social encounters, or real-world games

### 📱 Smart Interface
- **Dynamic Compass** – Points directly to your friend's location
- **Signal Strength Meter** – Visual representation of connection strength
- **Threshold Controls** – Adjustable proximity settings
- **Authentication Screens** – Secure user authentication interface

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Discovery Phase (BLE)
- One device **advertises** itself via BLE
- Another device **scans** and finds the target
- BLE sends **basic info** (WiFi SSID, unique ID)
- **RSSI-based** distance estimation

### 2️⃣ Data Exchange (WiFi Direct)
- Devices switch to **WiFi Direct** after discovery
- High-speed **GPS and compass data** exchange
- Real-time position updates
- Secure peer-to-peer connection

### 3️⃣ User Feedback
- **Bearing & distance** calculation
- **Progressive vibration** intensity
- Visual direction indicators
- Connection status updates
