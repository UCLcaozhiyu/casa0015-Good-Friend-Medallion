# **🔵 Good Friend Medallion - P2P BLE Finder**

**"Find your target, no server required."**

> 📌 **A Bluetooth-based peer-to-peer location and direction finder.**  
> Inspired by the **Witcher's medallion**, The program vibrates when you are near another user, and use Magic (BLE) to probe nearby Bluetooth devices to find out how far away they are from you, and the closer you are after docking that device, the stronger the vibration.

**"The Witcher Medallion – When danger is near, it trembles..."**
<sub>*Inspired by the Witcher's Medallion, this app helps you sense your target in the real world.*</sub>

## 🎯 Project Design Idea

### Core Concept
Just like the Witcher's medallion vibrates in the presence of magic, this app helps you sense your friends in the real world. The closer you get to your target, the stronger the vibration feedback becomes.

### Key Design Features
✅ **P2P Communication** – No cloud, no server, full privacy  
✅ **Real-time Distance & Direction** – Uses GPS & device sensors to calculate target location  
✅ **Vibration Feedback** – The closer you get, the stronger the vibration  
✅ **Works Offline** – Ideal for rescue, social encounters, or real-world games  

### How It Works
1. **Discovery via Bluetooth (BLE)**
   - One device advertises itself via BLE
   - Another device scans and finds the target

2. **Real-time Feedback**
   - The app calculates bearing & distance
   - Vibration intensity increases as you get closer
   - No internet required! Fully offline, private, secure

## Good Friends Medal v3.0 Introduction

## 🌟 Overview

Good Friend Medallion is an innovative mobile application that combines Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and GPS technology to help you find your friends in the real world. Just like the Witcher's medallion vibrates when magic is near, the app can also help you detect nearby Bluetooth devices and tell you the distance to you, this app provides haptic feedback as you get closer to Bluetooth signal source. Let all hidden Bluetooth devices have nowhere to hide before you!
